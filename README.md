# rpg_bot_python

My first project, doing this just to learn the language.

It's a program made to help RPG players. It works as a notebook/character chart/dice thrower.

To use it is really simple, just clone or download the files into the same folder. The .py file is the program and the .txt is where the program stores its data (Created characters and their stats).

The program is very customizable, can fit everyone's needs with just some small changes.

The more I learn about Python, I will update the program to make it the better it can be.

Thanks a lot.




#LITERALLY REBUILDING IT FROM STEP ONE, EVERYTHING WILL BECOME MORE INTUITIVE AND "CLEAN".

At the present time, there is no combat mechanic, the dice throws will be reworked, all menus will change and there will be a """plot"""
